# Picker Filter Fill

Makes managing inventories a lot easier!

Quickly and easily set filters and adjust requests using the handy dandy filter fill toolbar, Automatically shows up whenever you open a requester chest or filterable inventory. Requester chests can be made to quickly request all items in a blueprint by putting it in the first chest slot and clicking the button, or clicking the button with a blueprint in your hand. Copying from an assembler to a requester chest will add the new requests to the old ones instead of clearing them. Usefull for using one requester for multiple machines.
Automatically sort container inventories when opened. Can be toggled off and only sorted when keybind is used.
